= Portlet test bench

This application is for testing live portlet features both in the browser (click click) and by xUnit tests.
The xUnit tests are called by html2jsr286[http://github.com/lamikae/html2jsr286] and django-marionet[http://github.com/youleaf/django-marionet].

Caterpillar includes this portlet into a vanilla Rails application:

  rails new_app
  cd new_app
  caterpillar pluginize

Edit the config/routes as instructed by the previous command.

The command
  caterpillar portlets

Should output

 * Portlet configuration ***********************
Caterpillar
	Rails-portlet test bench      "portlet_test_bench"	[]


Now launch the Webrick server and navigate to http://localhost:3000/caterpillar/test_bench
