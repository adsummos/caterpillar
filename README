Caterpillar helps you with building Rails applications to be used in Java
JSR286 portlets. This is possible with the help of Rails-portlet[http://rails-portlet.rubyforge.org].

Writing Rails portlets for Liferay is great fun!
Caterpillar tasks offer specialized methods for better Liferay integration:

++xml++ and ++xml:deploy++
 - processes the portlet XML configuration in accordance with the named routes
See Caterpillar::Config

++jar:install++
 - installs the Rails-portlet JAR into Liferay's classpath

++deploy++
 - warbles the application, updates the XML configuration and copies these to Liferay

++pluginize++
 - provides a navigation view in development (you will have to enable it manually)
See Caterpillar::Navigation

++db:migrate++
 - offers a set of migrations to help with Liferay integration

 - patches Web::Portlet in the lportal[http://lportal.rubyforge.org] library, so manipulating
   portlets is easier. This requires running the migrations.

++fixtures++
 - imports live data from the production database for testing


See the rdoc documentation and caterpillar --describe for the full feature list.
