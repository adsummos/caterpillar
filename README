Caterpillar helps you with building Rails applications to be used in Java
JSR286 portlets. This is possible with the help of Rails-portlet[http://rails-portlet.rubyforge.org].

Rails portlets have been used on Liferay and the helpers offer specialized methods to support better Liferay integration.

This package offers these functionalities:

 - processes the portlet XML configuration in accordance with the named routes
See Caterpillar::Config

 - provides a navigation view in development (you will have to enable it manually)
See Caterpillar::Navigation

 - offers a set of migrations to help with Liferay integration

 - provides a Rake task 'fixtures', which imports live data
   from the production database for testing



See the rdoc documentation and caterpillar --describe for the feature list.
